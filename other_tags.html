        Give text" most commonly refers to Text-to-Give, 
        a convenient fundraising method where people text 
        a keyword and amount (e.g., "GIVE 20") to a specific 
        number to donate instantly from their phones, 
        with the money processed and recorded for nonprofits.
         It also can mean adding text to images (like in Canva) 
         or sending a simple text message. For donations,
          it's a quick way for supporters to contribute via SMS, 
          often linking to a secure payment 
        form for first-time donors to set up their details.
